# CS155_Shakespeare_Sonnet_Generator
Machine learning project for sonnet generation based on Shakespeare's 154 sonnets. 

The format of this is a Google colab with the following sections: 
The preprocessing of the data set (all of Shakeseare's sonnets)
An implementation of a Naive HMM with different numbers of hidden states
An implementation of a character-based LSTM model using a RNN
Adding syllables and rhyme for a less Naive HMM
An RNN that trains on/generates entire words instead of single characters
Visualisations
